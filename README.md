Hello, friends! If you're reading this, I'm either in the process of writing - or have finished writing - a series of **blog posts** on the [Fantasy Land](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land) specification for typeclasses in JavaScript - hooray!

When _I_ started trying to get to grips with the Fantasy Land spec and its uses, I spent most of my day with this expression:

The thing is that a lot of these patterns are going to be **pretty weird** if you're coming from a different paradigm (most likely **OOP**).

In any case, it's probably going to be helpful to have some examples. With that in mind, I'm going to fill this repo with exactly that, and refer to it whenever _I_ get stuck.

I'll aim to include **all examples and exercises** from [the blog series](http://www.tomharding.me/2017/03/03/fantas-eel-and-specification/), as well as some new ones as I stumble across them. If you want to contribute, _please_ **submit pull requests** with updates to the current examples, or even exciting new stuff! All discussion is productive, and (if you haven't guessed) I _love_ talking about this stuff. Heads up: I intend to uphold a [**code of conduct**](https://wealljs.org/code-of-conduct), as we're all _hopefully_ more interested in functional programming than upsetting each other. I'm optimistic!

Finally, **ask questions**! I'm by no means an expert, but I'll do my best to be useful, or at least point you in the direction of more helpful people. I don't know about you, but I like the idea of a **functional future** for JS, so it's _totally_ in my best interests to clarify anything that might confuse people.

Thanks!
